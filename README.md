# Jason's Personal Projects Repository

This repository serves as a collection of various personal projects, coursework, and LeetCode solutions. It showcases my work in different areas of computer science and engineering.

## Directory Structure and Project Overviews

-   **`advanced_compiler/`**:
    This directory contains coursework for an advanced compiler course, featuring implementations of LLVM passes for program analysis and reports on compiler-related topics.
    -   `hw1/`: Data Dependency Analysis using LLVM IR.
    -   `hw2/`: Pointer Analysis data flow analyzer for C programs.
    -   `hw3/`: Reports discussing array languages.
    -   `llvm_build/`: Basic "Hello World" LLVM pass example and build artifacts.

-   **`chyhsu.github.io/`**:
    This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, hosted on GitHub Pages. It's built using Jekyll and showcases my academic and professional background.

-   **`computer_architecture/`**:
    (No specific README found, likely contains coursework or projects related to computer architecture.)

-   **`cv/`**:
    Contains my curriculum vitae (CV) in LaTeX format, along with compiled PDF versions.

-   **`file_translator/`**:
    A PDF translator tool that converts English PDF documents into Traditional Chinese using Google's Gemini AI. It extracts text and visual elements, generates LaTeX code, and compiles it to maintain the original layout.

-   **`lab1/`**:
    (No specific README found, likely contains materials for a computer organization lab, possibly involving MIPS assembly and the MARS simulator.)

-   **`Lab2/`**:
    (No specific README found, likely contains materials for a computer organization lab, possibly related to ALU and Shifter design.)

-   **`Lab3/`**:
    (No specific README found, likely contains materials for a computer organization lab, possibly related to CPU design with Verilog modules like ALU, Data Memory, Instruction Memory, etc.)

-   **`Lab4/`**:
    (No specific README found, likely contains materials for a computer organization lab.)

-   **`LeetCode/`**:
    A personal repository containing my solutions to various LeetCode problems, all implemented in C++. Solutions are categorized, with an underscore prefix indicating particularly important or challenging problems.

-   **`myself_mcp/`**:
    (No specific README found, likely a personal project or module, possibly Python-based given the `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`.)

-   **`課程講義/`**:
    (No specific README found, likely contains course lecture notes or handouts, possibly related to computer organization given the file names like `CO-Ch1.pdf`.)
