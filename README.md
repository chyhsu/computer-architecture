# Directory Structure and Project Overviews


-   **`lab1/`**:
    This directory contains materials for a computer organization lab focused on MIPS programming. It includes C and MIPS assembly code examples (bubble sort, factorial, fibonacci) and instructions for using the MARS MIPS simulator.

-   **`Lab2/`**:
    This directory contains materials for a computer organization lab focusing on the design of an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) and Shifter using Verilog.

-   **`Lab3/`**:
    This directory contains materials for a computer organization lab focused on designing a simple single-cycle CPU using various Verilog modules such as ALU, Data Memory, Instruction Memory, Register File, and Control Unit.

-   **`Lab4/`**:
    This directory contains materials for a computer organization lab focusing on pipelined CPU design. It includes basic and bonus implementations of a pipelined CPU in Verilog, addressing data and control hazards with forwarding and stalling mechanisms.
