# Jason's Personal Projects Repository

This repository serves as a collection of various personal projects, coursework, and LeetCode solutions. It showcases my work in different areas of computer science and engineering.

## Directory Structure and Project Overviews

-   **`advanced_compiler/`**:
    This directory contains coursework for an advanced compiler course, featuring implementations of LLVM passes for program analysis and reports on compiler-related topics.
    -   `hw1/`: Data Dependency Analysis using LLVM IR.
    -   `hw2/`: Pointer Analysis data flow analyzer for C programs.
    -   `hw3/`: Reports discussing array languages.
    -   `llvm_build/`: Basic "Hello World" LLVM pass example and build artifacts.

-   **`chyhsu.github.io/`**:
    This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, hosted on GitHub Pages. It's built using Jekyll and showcases my academic and professional background.

-   **`computer_architecture/`**:
    This directory contains coursework and projects related to computer architecture. It includes labs covering MIPS programming, ALU/Shifter design, single-cycle CPU design, and pipelined CPU design using Verilog.

-   **`cv/`**:
    Contains my curriculum vitae (CV) in LaTeX format, along with compiled PDF versions.

-   **`file_translator/`**:
    A PDF translator tool that converts English PDF documents into Traditional Chinese using Google's Gemini AI. It extracts text and visual elements, generates LaTeX code, and compiles it to maintain the original layout.

-   **`lab1/`**:
    This directory contains materials for a computer organization lab focused on MIPS programming. It includes C and MIPS assembly code examples (bubble sort, factorial, fibonacci) and instructions for using the MARS MIPS simulator.

-   **`Lab2/`**:
    This directory contains materials for a computer organization lab focusing on the design of an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) and Shifter using Verilog.

-   **`Lab3/`**:
    This directory contains materials for a computer organization lab focused on designing a simple single-cycle CPU using various Verilog modules such as ALU, Data Memory, Instruction Memory, Register File, and Control Unit.

-   **`Lab4/`**:
    This directory contains materials for a computer organization lab focusing on pipelined CPU design. It includes basic and bonus implementations of a pipelined CPU in Verilog, addressing data and control hazards with forwarding and stalling mechanisms.

-   **`LeetCode/`**:
    A personal repository containing my solutions to various LeetCode problems, all implemented in C++. Solutions are categorized, with an underscore prefix indicating particularly important or challenging problems.

-   **`myself_mcp/`**:
    (No specific README found, likely a personal project or module, possibly Python-based given the `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`.)

-   **`課程講義/`**:
    This directory contains course lecture notes and handouts related to computer organization, including topics like computer abstractions and technology.

Each project directory may contain its own `README.md` with more specific details on how to build, run, or understand the project.
